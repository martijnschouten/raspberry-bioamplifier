The prints are made on a FlashForge Creator Pro fitted with a Flexion Extruder. The material used is NinjaFlex for the non conductive parts and PI-ETPU 85-700+ (http://palmiga.com) for the conducive parts. 

Band_ETPU.stl and Band_NinjaFlex.stl are one model, the .stl files have the same coordinate axis and can easily be combined in sliver software like simplfy3D, then assign each .stl to one material. BandCapEtpu.stl and BandCapNinjaFlex.stl are also one model.
